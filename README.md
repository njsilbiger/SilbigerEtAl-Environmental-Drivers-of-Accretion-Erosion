# Title: Environmental drivers of coral reef carbonate production and bioerosion: a multi-scale analysis

This repository includes data  for the above manuscript

**Authors:** Nyssa J. Silbiger*, Megan J. Donahue, and Russell E. Brainard
 

**Funding:** This project was funded by the NOAA Nancy Foster Scholarship Program to NJS, the HIMB-NWHI Partnership Program to MJD, the Jessie D Kay Memorial Fellowship to NJS, and the University of Hawaii SeaGrant Program to MJD. 
 
**Journal:**  Ecology

**Contents:** There are two folders and a README.md file.

**Clean Data:** Raw accretion/erosion rates and site averages data for benthic cover, chemical data, herbivore biomass and the physical data. These are the QA/QC data used in the analysis  
  
* Accretion Erosion Rates.csv
* Benthic Cover Data.csv
* Chemical Data.csv
* Herbivore Biomass.csv
* Physical Data.csv

**Raw Data:** These are the original data files (which are not QA/QC) with all the MATLAB code and functions that I used to QA/QC and analyze the data.
